                <h2>The Visual Horizon</h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever looked up on a clear day and wondered about the depth of the color above you? The sky is not simply a ceiling; it is a vast, gaseous ocean that wraps around our planet. This article explores the physics of light, the chemistry of air, and the psychology of the color blue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Glassmorphism, the design style you are seeing right now, mimics this very atmosphere. It relies on transparency, background blurring, and subtle borders to create a sense of depth and hierarchy, much like looking through layers of clouds.

                    <h3>Rayleigh Scattering</h3>
                    <p>Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as smaller, shorter waves.</p>

                    <h3>The Spectrum</h3>
                    <p>While the sun emits a full spectrum of light, our eyes are more sensitive to blue frequencies. Violet is scattered even more, but the sun emits less of it, and our eyes absorb it less efficiently.</p>

                <p>
                    When we discuss the "Stratosphere," we are referring to the second major layer of Earth's atmosphere, just above the troposphere, and below the mesosphere. It is stratified in temperature, with warmer layers higher up and cooler layers farther down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is in contrast to the troposphere near the Earth's surface, where temperature decreases with altitude. The border between the troposphere and stratosphere, the tropopause, marks the limit of most weather disturbances.

                <h3>Why Blue Calms Us</h3>
                <p>
                    Psychologically, blue is associated with open spaces, freedom, intuition, imagination, expansiveness, inspiration, and sensitivity. It also represents meanings of depth, trust, loyalty, sincerity, wisdom, confidence, stability, faith, heaven, and intelligence.

                    In web design, using these hues reduces eye strain and signals to the user that the environment is safe and stable.
